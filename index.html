  <h3>Meatier meals and more playtime might reduce cats’ toll on wildlife</h3>

  <p class="subhead">Surprisingly simple measures might keep domestic cats from killing a lot of wildlife.</p>

  <p class="article-tidbit">Estimates vary, but it’s likely that billions of birds and mammals succumb each year to our outdoor-ranging feline friends. Calls to keep cats indoors are often contentious among cat owners, and cats can sometimes reject colorful collars or loud bells designed to make them more noticeable.</p>

  <h3>First picture of a sunlike star with multiple exoplanets</h3>
  <p class="subhead">Unlike our solar system, this one has two massive gas giants with far-out orbits. The star TYC 8998-760-1 (top center) was photographed with two giant exoplanets (arrows), the first time astronomers have directly imaged more than one planet orbiting a sunlike star.</p>

  <h3>Tiny, sunlight-powered aircraft could soar beyond airplanes’ reach</h3>
  <p class="subhead">Light is all that’s needed to levitate these microfibers. Flight isn’t easy at the edge of space. But tiny “microfliers” could soar high in Earth’s atmosphere fueled only by sunlight, experiments suggest. At heights between about 50 and 80 kilometers above Earth’s surface, in what’s known as the mesosphere, the atmosphere is so thin that airplanes and balloons can’t stay aloft. </p>

  <h3>Fin whale songs can reveal hidden features of the ocean floor</h3>
  <p class="subhead">It can even penetrate into Earth’s crust, a new study finds. Echoes in whale songs recorded by seismic instruments on the ocean floor reveal that the sound waves pass through layers of sediment and underlying rock. These songs can help probe the structure of the crust when more conventional survey methods are not available, researchers report in the Feb. 12 Science.</p>
